Got it! If the `assets` folder is inside the `src` folder (i.e., `src/assets`), you'll need to update the image paths accordingly in the README.

Here’s the updated version of the `README.md` file with the correct image paths:

### Description

The `frontend/` directory contains all the frontend code for the React application.

- **src/assets/**: Contains the image assets used throughout the app. Images are named as `out1.png` to `out7.png` and can be found in this folder.

### Images

The following images are included in the `src/assets/` folder:

- ![out1](./src/assets/out1.png)
- ![out2](./src/assets/out2.png)
- ![out3](./src/assets/out3.png)
- ![out4](./src/assets/out4.png)
- ![out5](./src/assets/out5.png)
- ![out6](./src/assets/out6.png)
- ![out7](./src/assets/out7.png)

These images can be used in various components within the app.
